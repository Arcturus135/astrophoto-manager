# astrophoto-manager

This small application is designed to help people to keep track of their astrophotos.
I can tell that it's hard to do so, that's why I spent some of my time in developing this.

If you have any ideas of how to improve it or if there are any issues with this, please let me know.

# Installation

The installation is pretty easy. You just have to download the astrophoto-manager.jar file and put it in a seperate folder on your computer as it will generate some files to store your astrophoto data.
